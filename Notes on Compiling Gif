Compiling Gif
-------------

Instead of opening the HTML file directly from your file system, set up a local development server such as Python's built-in http.server to run.

Navigate to EstelaGif folder and run the following Command: python -m http.server

Now, you can access the page/gif at http://localhost:8000/index.html in your web browser. 

The reason behind this is because when attempting to run my HTML file on Chrome, I encountered security restrictions that prevented cross-origin requests when loading resources for the web page. This was particularly with the particles.json file, since it uses a XMLHttpRequest from a local file origin, which is not allowed due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies. To resolve this, we can simply run on a local development server.
